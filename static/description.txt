This is Abhiram Kamini an undergrad student pursuing my degree with a major in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. 

I am not just a student who focuses on theoretical learning but I am someone who believes in overall development as a person with communication skills and hobbies and as an Engineer with practical knowledge, I aim to keep learning and evolving.

Technology has changed the world around us so much and it is rapidly growing where we have reached a stage where 
"with data from our mobile phones we can predict what is going on in our whole life"
so we need to put the right path for our coming generations to understand and protect that data. I aim to make use of the data properly and ethically in the field of AI.

I am a young passionate student pursuing my engineering degree in Artificial Intelligence is looking to gain much exposure to the real-world applications of the study I am pursuing, I don't just want to learn but also apply knowledge for a better cause and help society.
